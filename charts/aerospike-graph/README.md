# Deploying Aerospike Graph Service with Kubernetes and Helm
If you're just getting started with trying out [Aerospike Graph Service](https://aerospike.com/docs/graph)
(AGS), you may wish to start with a local deployment for testing purposes. When you're ready to
deploy AGS in a production environment, you'll probably want to use
containerization and orchestration tools. This guide is intended to illustrate deploying AGS
with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

## Prerequisites
- A running instance of [Aerospike Database Server](https://aerospike.com/docs/database)
  with an accessible IP address and port.
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

## Adding the helm chart repository
Add the `aerospike` helm repository if not already done

```shell
helm repo add aerospike https://artifact.aerospike.io/helm
```

## Usage
The arguments you pass to the `helm` command depend on your Aerospike Server
network and namespace configuration. The prototype form of the command is as
follows:
```bash noCopy
$ helm [INSTALL|UPGRADE] [RELEASE-NAME] aerospike/aerospike-graph \
    --set 'env[0].name=[GRAPH-CONFIG-NAME]' \
    --set 'env[1].name=[GRAPH-CONFIG-NAME]' \
    ...
```
All the [configuration options](https://aerospike.com/docs/graph/configuring/options)
listed in the Graph documentation are available to pass in as environment variables.
You can also edit the file `aerospike-graph/values.yaml` to specify environment
variables.

## Example commands
The following example command:
- Creates a helm release named `test-pod`.
- Specifies `10.32.32.77:3000` as the IP address and port of the Aerospike
  database server.
- Specifies `test` as the namespace to use on the Aerospike database.
```bash
$ helm install test-pod aerospike/aerospike-graph \
  --set 'env[0].name=aerospike.client.host' \
  --set 'env[0].value=10.32.32.77:3000' \
  --set 'env[1].name=aerospike.client.namespace' \
  --set 'env[1].value=test'
```
If the command is successful, output similar to the following appears:
```ascii
NAME: test-pod
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Mar  6 14:01:54 2024
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
     NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
           You can watch the status of by running 'kubectl get --namespace default svc -w test-pod-aerospike-graph'
  export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default test-pod-aerospike-graph --template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{.}}{{ end }}")
  echo http://$SERVICE_IP:8182
```
You can use all the standard Kubernetes commands to inspect and alter your pods.
```ascii
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                        READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
test-pod-aerospike-graph-789b9f954f-fsgd5   1/1     Running             0          3m8s
```
Once your AGS instance is up and running, you can connect to it over
the [Gremlin websocket port](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.6.4/reference/#connecting-gremlin-server).
For more information about using the Gremlin console with AGS, see
[Basic Graph Usage](https://aerospike.com/docs/graph/getting-started/basic-usage).
You can get networking information about your active pods with the `get services` command:
```ascii
$ kubectl get services
NAME                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)          AGE
test-pod-aerospike-graph   LoadBalancer   10.24.11.39   34.133.189.165   8182:32490/TCP   4m46s
```
You can alter your pod configuration with the `helm upgrade command`. Use the `replicaCount`
argument to adjust the number of running pods:
```ascii
$ helm upgrade test-pod aerospike/aerospike-graph \
  --set 'env[0].name=aerospike.client.host' \
  --set 'env[0].value=10.32.32.77:3000' \
  --set 'env[1].name=aerospike.client.namespace' \
  --set 'env[1].value=test' \
  --set replicaCount=3
...
$ kubectl get pods -w
NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
test-pod-aerospike-graph-697dcdfcb8-sb9xt   1/1     Running   0          6s
test-pod-aerospike-graph-697dcdfcb8-sfcmr   1/1     Running   0          6s
test-pod-aerospike-graph-697dcdfcb8-v2x5z   1/1     Running   0          6s
```

## Configuring the `values.yaml` file
You can set AGS configuration options in the `values.yaml` file. At the
bottom of the file, there are environment variables which are commented
out by default. You can uncomment the existing variables and add others
as needed. For a complete list of AGS configuration options, see the
[documentation](https://aerospike.com/docs/graph/configuring/options).
For more information about the `values.yaml` file, see the
[Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/).
